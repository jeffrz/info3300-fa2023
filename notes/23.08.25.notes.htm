    <h3>Notes for Friday, August 25</h3>
    <p>
      You can access these files from the <a href="https://github.com/jeffrz/info3300-fa2023">course Github repository</a>. The repository will be updated with notes shortly after class. While I encourage you to make use of a local copy of the repository so you can take notes, the version at this site will always be up-to-date and accessible. Execute a <tt>git pull</tt> in your repository directory to download new files. Prompt files won't change after posting, so feel free to modify them as you like. Here is an <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">informal guide to git</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To develop efficiently, have a local web server running. Python has a simple, built-in server. Use <tt>python -m http.server</tt> for python 3; use <tt>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000</tt> for python 2 (execute python in cmd for version number).
    </p>  
    <p>
        How does Javascript differ among popular web browsers? <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a> breaks down browser support and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">Browser Usage</a> on Wikipedia shows current market share. Count on your TAs using recent Chrome browsers to evaluate your assignments, but remember that much of the world may not.

    // * Let's talk JSON
    // JSON is used as a way to convey complex data over the web (e.g. getting data from an API elsewhere)
    // Key benefit over something like serialization is that it is standardized and very human-readable

    let obj = [{"name":"DDWA", "number":3300 },{"name": "Java", "number": 2110},{"name": "Python", "number": 1110}];
    console.log(obj);
    let jsonObj = JSON.stringify(obj) // Here is a JSON string for that object
    console.log(jsonObj);
    console.log(typeof(jsonObj));
    console.log( JSON.parse(jsonObj) );

    // This one won't parse because it breaks JSON specifications
    let badStr = '{"list": ["commas,", "single_quo\'tes", "double_quo"tes", "@sÃ§i|"], "nestedObject": {"undefined": undefined, "defined": 3.1415926535}, "Infinity": Infinity, "NaN": NaN, "bool": true}'
    //console.log(JSON.parse(badStr));
    // Here is the fixed version, note escaped quotes, eliminated undefined, and no reserved numbers
    // The \' is present because I used '' to create the string and need to escape quotes within it
    // The \\" is present to escape the backslash so that the JSON string has \" in it, which is a required by the spec
    let goodStr = '{"list": ["commas,", "single_quo\'tes", "double_quo\\"tes", "@sçi|"], "nestedObject": {"undefined": null, "defined": 3.1415926535}, "bool": true}'
    console.log(goodStr);
    console.log(JSON.parse(goodStr));
    
    
    // Done incorrectly, the JSON parser can make you think you've fixed errors when you actually haven't
    var fib = '[1; 2; 3; 5; 7; 12]';
    //let fib = '"[1; 2; 3; 5; 7; 12]"';
    //console.log(JSON.parse(fib));
  
  
    // * Let's play with scoping of variables
    //    We have three different declarations, var, const, and let
    //    Var came earlier, const & let more recently
    //    (only use VAR if you really mean it!)
    let fruit = "banana";
    var veg = "carrot";
    const legume = "peanut";
    
    console.log("--start");
    console.log(fruit);
    console.log(veg);
    console.log(legume);
    
    if (fruit === "banana") {   // curly braces signal we have entered the if statement's block scope
      let fruit = "pineapple";
      var veg = "broccoli";
      // const legume = "lentil";  // const should not be overwritten
      
      console.log("--in if");
      console.log(fruit);
      console.log(veg);
    }
    console.log("--out if");
    console.log(fruit);
    console.log(veg);
    
    // Notice how the "veg" change leaks outside of the "if" scope, but "fruit" does not stay overwritten -- it only changes within the block
    
    // let is a "block-scoped" declaration -- it behaves most like what you're familiar with in Python, so use it 
    // var is usually globally scoped or scoped within a function() -- this can create unexpected issues
    // Only use var for things you want to access everywhere -- ideally just set them to const at the top of the file if possible
    
    // Let's look at scopes in script tags
    let test = "script tags. how do they work?";
    
    // Let's look at *hoisting* of variables
    console.log(x);
    var x = 5;
    console.log(x);
    // *declarations* are hoisted, but not the values themselves
    // This explains why commenting out the first "let fruit" line causes an error but commenting out "var veg" does not -- it's hoisted
    
    
  
    // * Conditionals, functions and loops in c/java style and functional style.
    //   (to learn more about functions, check out http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/)
    
    // If statements:
    let y = 5;
    if ( y === 5 ) { console.log("equals 5"); }
    else if ( y === 6 ) { console.log("equals 6"); }
    else { console.log("equals something else"); }
    
          
    // The more familiar format specifies a name for the function.
    console.log( favoriteColor() );
    function favoriteColor() {
      return "red";
    }
    console.log( favoriteColor() );
    // Note that we can use favoriteColor() *above* the function declaration because it is also hoisted
    // This only works with the *function name() { }* style function declaration
    //   There are going to be some other cases this term where *function name() { }* declarations are special


    // We can also declare an "anonymous" function and then give it a name.
    var favoriteNumber = function() { return 51; }
    // But notice that both styles have exactly the same effect:
    //  they create a variable whose value is a function.


    // We can pass a function as an argument. Note the difference between
    //  f and f(). One is the function itself
    function display(f) {
      console.log( f() );  // We take in function f as a parameter, then run it in this line
    }
    display(favoriteColor);
    display(favoriteNumber);
    
    // EXTRA INFO AFTER CLASS:
    // We can also return functions as a form of lazy execution!
    // Functions remember the variables that were available when they were defined. This can enable lazy evaluation
    function addOne( number ) {
      return function() { return number + 1; }
    }
    console.log( addOne(1) );   // we get a function back 
    console.log( addOne(1)() )  // which we can then execute if we want
    //  ...but unlike some functional programming languages, this has some overhead so it isn't a great pattern to use for everything


    // Finally, in modern javascript there is a handy shortcut -- arrow functions
    let bestAnimal = () => { console.log("dog"); }
    let addNums = (num1, num2) => { return num1 + num2; }
    let addTwo = number => { return number+2; } // If you only have one parameter, you can skip the parentheses
    let addThree = number => number+3; // If you are immediately returning, you can actually just skip the { } and return
      
    
    // * Brief foray into "destructuring"
    // Javascript can help to destructure objects and arrays during variable assignment
    //  (Credit for some examples goes to https://codeburst.io/es6-destructuring-the-complete-guide-7f842d08b98f -- check this out for lots of other capabilities and examples of destructuring)
    
    // Destructuring arrays
    let color = [24, 50, 240];
    // let r = color[0];
    // let g = color[1];
    // let b = color[2];
    
    let [r, g, b] = color;
    console.log(r,g,b);
    
    
    // Destructuring objects (dictionaries) 
    let student = {name: "Herb Ertlinger", class: "INFO3300", age:21};
    
    function printStudent( { name: nm, class: cls} ) {   // It also works when function parameters are declared!
      console.log(nm, cls);
    }
    printStudent(student);
    
    
    // You can take destructuring pretty far
    // For example, you can use it to simplify variable swaps
    let width = 50;
    let height = 100;
    
    // let t = width;
    // let width = height;
    // let height = t;
    //   ...becomes
    [height, width] = [width, height];
    
    console.log(width, height);
    

    
    // * Now a bit of looping
    let list = ["red","green","blue","yellow"];
    for (let i=0; i<list.length; i++) { 
      console.log(list[i]);
    }
    
    // There are a few different operators you can try
    for (let index in list) {
      console.log(index);
    }
    // "__ in list" gives you indices and keys
    
    for (let obj of list) {
      console.log(obj);
    }
    // "__ of list" gives you elements in the list (does not work on dicts -- for that use "___ of Object.entries(dict)"
    
    
    list.forEach( d => {
      console.log(d);
    });
    // This is an incredibly common pattern in JS
    // .forEach requires that you provide one parameter which is a function
    //   The function you give it will get one object at a time from the list as a parameter
    //   so the item => { } you see here is an arrow function that is run for each item in the array
    
    
    // Note: the Object class has a bunch of other useful static methods for arrays and dicts
    // One common one we'll use is Object.entries( dict ) that gives you all entries in a dict-like object
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#static_methods
    
    
    // One last pattern -- utility functions that require you to provide a "getter" function
    
    // Imagine that someone else wrote this function that does something cool to student names
    //  ...but, they don't know what your list of data looks like, and they don't want to force you to use a specific
    //   data structure or follow some specific schema in order to use their code
    // Your data looks like this, and you know the name key for each item in the list has what the function needs
    let students = [{name: "Herb Ertlinger", class:"INFO3300", age:21}, {name: "Glerb Mertlinger", class:"INFO5100", age:20}, {name: "Tarp Ertlerga", class:"CS3300", age:20}];
    
    // Instead, the function designer makes you provide a "getter" function kind of like in .forEach, that is run for each of the items
    //   in the list and helps the function get to the data it needs, no matter what your data structure looks like
    // In this case, notice how the nameProcessor iterates, and uses the getterFunc that the user provides to find the name
    function nameProcessor( lst, getterFunc ) {
      for (let obj of lst) {
        console.log('The name is:', getterFunc( obj ) );
      }
    }
    
    // So we give nameProcessor an anonymous getter function that says "for each item d in our list, in order to get the name you need, run d['name']"
    nameProcessor( students, d => d['name'] );
    // functionally equivalent to:  nameProcessor( students, function(d) {return d['name']} )

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    // Note: the Object class has a bunch of other useful static methods for arrays and dicts
    // One common one we'll use is Object.entries( dict ) that gives you all entries in a dict-like object
